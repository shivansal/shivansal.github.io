									<h3 class="major">What Is It?</h3>
									<p>At HackingEDU Hackathon, we built a multiplayer educational web-application named BrainWars that bridges the gap between learning and having fun. The essential purpose of this project was to connect students in order to enhance learning. As students in high school we recognize problems students and we took those into consideration when building this application. This web application used the Quizlet API in which we took quizlet flash card contents and created a multiplayer platform. A user would login into the website and is able to access to their profile, play options, etc. When user decides to play, he/she chooses a Quizlet set and connects with either their friend or a random stranger. From there, students are connected and are able to verse each other in series of games.




At the hackathon, we received the pleasure to meet the Founder and CTO of Quizlet, Andrew Sutherland. We sat down with him and explained our application with him. We had a talk and discussed the future of Quizlet and its approach at making a multiplayer platform. He took interest in our project and is looking forward to see this project move forward. We were truly blessed to meet him. 

This project has re-entered development in order to enhance the program. We will be republishing the application in a few weeks.

                                    <h3 class="major">How is it Built?</h3>

									<p>This application's front-end was built in HTML/CSS, JQuery, and made aesthetically pleasing using BootStrap. The application's backend was built in Node.js, JS, and was hosted using Meteor.
</p>

									<h3 class="major">My Job</h3>
									<p>I was responsible for the UI/UX platform and the design of our product. I used many different tools in order to efficiently complete this project such as Brackets.io,  Atom.io,  Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and much more. </p>
